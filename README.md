# Coding Challenge for SPO

# Challenge Title: Workforce Optimization

# The Algorithm:

Considering the constrains defined (in the challenge description) by limiting the number of structures and rooms to 100, I simply implemented the brute force way to examine all possible solutions.
# How to run:
Extract the zip archive and go to the bin directory and simply run: ./start
Any REST client can be used to send the exact json strings by a POST method to this address:
http://localhost:8080/servicepartner/workercount
And get the exact same results described in the Example's part of the description.

# Available resources:
Sources and pom.xml file are available.
Also the executable version is provided in the SPO.zip archive.
